# OWASP FinBot CTF â€“ Contributor Hub

Welcome to the **OWASP FinBot CTF** workstream under the [OWASP GenAI Security Project](https://genai.owasp.org/).  
This is a community-driven initiative to build one of the first **agentic AI Capture the Flag (CTF)** platforms â€“ designed to raise awareness of new security risks such as **goal manipulation, memory poisoning, and agent misbehavior**.  

FinBot is part of the OWASP Agentic Security Initiative (ASI) and is open source on GitHub.  
We rely on volunteers to build, test, and grow this platform together. ðŸš€

## ðŸŒŸ What is FinBot?
[owasp-finbot-ctf.org](https://owasp-finbot-ctf.org)

**FinBot** is a fictional (but real!) AI Agent in charge of:  
- Processing invoices for media services  
- Approving or denying invoices  
- Making financial decisions on behalf of a company  

Like real AI agents, FinBot is vulnerable to **agentic AI threats** such as:  
- **Goal Manipulation** â€“ attackers redirecting the agentâ€™s objectives  
- **Repudiation & Untraceability** â€“ lack of logs, opaque decision-making  
- **Misaligned & Deceptive Behaviors** â€“ bypassing constraints, misleading outputs  
- **Memory Poisoning** â€“ polluting stored context to change behavior  

These challenges are mapped directly to the [OWASP Agentic AI Threats & Mitigations Guide](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/agentic-ai-threats-and-mitigations/).

## ðŸ’¡ What Weâ€™re Building

The OWASP FinBot CTF is an **educational platform** for exploring risks in agentic AI applications.  
Our goals include:  
- Building hands-on CTF challenges around **agentic AI threats** (goal manipulation, memory poisoning, etc.).  
- Demonstrating **mitigations and best practices** for securing AI agents.  
- Designing modular challenges that can grow into different FinBot scenarios.  
- Enabling a community of learners, researchers, and developers to gain practical skills.  

This project is a collaborative experiment: weâ€™re learning, breaking, and securing agentic AI together.
