# Volunteer Role: Quality & Security Engineer (OWASP FinBot CTF)

## What you’ll do
- Test CTF challenges to make sure they work smoothly for participants.  
- Look for security issues and bugs in FinBot challenges; test AI with AI (e.g., PyRIT).  
- Give feedback to developers to improve design and usability.  
- Work under the direction of a technical lead: you’ll be given activities and guidance, but also the chance to explore and problem-solve independently — with support from other contributors.  

## Skills that help
- Basic understanding of CTFs, quality & security testing.  
- Curiosity to “break things” and explore edge cases.  
- Interest in agentic AI and how security challenges are built.  

## Who this is ideal for
Students, new grads, or anyone eager to gain experience in security engineering, testing, agentic AI applications, and contributing to open source projects.  

## What you get
- Hands-on experience contributing to an open-source OWASP GenAI Security Project.  
- Learn about agentic AI security while working on FinBot challenges.  
- Build skills in security testing and quality assurance.  
- Recognition as a contributor to a global OWASP project.
